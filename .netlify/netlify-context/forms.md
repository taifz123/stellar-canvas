## General

- The `.netlify` folder is not for user code. Add it to `.gitignore`.
- Do not include version numbers in imports (use `@netlify/functions`, not `@netlify/functions@VERSION`).
- Never add CORS headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`) unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Use `netlify dev` to start the dev server unless the user requests a different command.

## Guidelines

- Netlify Blobs: Use for general object/state/data storage.
- Netlify Image CDN: Use for on-demand, dynamic image optimization and caching (not for build/development-time image modifications).
- Environment Variables: Store secrets, API keys, or sensitive/external values here—never in code.

## Local Development Troubleshooting

- If Netlify platform primitives (Blobs, Functions, etc.) aren't working locally, ensure `@netlify/vite-plugin` is installed for Vite-powered projects (or `@netlify/nuxt` for Nuxt, or `@netlify/vite-plugin-tanstack-start` for TanStack Start), configured, and you're running the framework's dev command directly (e.g., `npm run dev`). This enables full local platform primitives emulation.




  ## Netlify Forms

  If using Netlify Forms, prevent spam submissions with a honeypot field.
